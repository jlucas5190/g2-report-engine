#summary Shows how to save your ReportDefinition as an XML file

= Introduction =

Most report engines choose to save their report definitions to XML for future use. This functionality is also provided by the `ReportSerializationUtil` class. A number of methods provide the ability to convert a `ReportDefinition` to xml and back.

In the [MyFirstReport My First Report tutorial] we created a `ReportDefinition` object with a "Hello World" label. We could have easily saved this report to an XML file for future re-use.
{{{
ReportSerializationUtil.toXMLFile(new File("HelloWorld.xml"), report);
}}}

We could also have saved this report as an XML string for easy storage in a database, for example.
{{{
String xml = ReportSerializationUtil.toXMLString(report);
}}}

= XML to Java = 

Once a `ReportDefinition` has been persisted to XML, either a file or string, it is easy to convert it back
{{{
/* Get report definition from XML file */
ReportDefinition report = ReportSerializationUtil.fromXMLFile(new File("HelloWorld.xml"));

/* Get report definition from XML string */
ReportDefinition report = ReportSerializationUtil.fromXMLString("<xml ...");
}}}

Of course, you typically don't need worry about converting your report from XML to a `ReportDefinition`. This is handled by the `HTMLReportBuilder` and `ExcelReportBuilder` facades, which attempt to hide the complexities for report generation from the developer.
